## 🚀 Getting Started (5 Steps)

### Step 1: Set Up Free Database (10 minutes)

**What is a database?** It's like a filing cabinet that stores all your website data.

1. Go to [MongoDB.com](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register)
2. Click "Sign Up" (it's FREE forever)
3. Choose the **FREE** option (M0 Sandbox)
4. Click "Create Cluster" and wait 3-5 minutes
5. Write down the connection string (looks like a long URL)

**📖 Detailed Guide:** See [ADMIN_SETUP_GUIDE.md](ADMIN_SETUP_GUIDE.md#database-setup)

### Step 2: Set Up Free Image Storage (5 minutes)

**What is Cloudinary?** It's like Google Photos for your website.

1. Go to [Cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free)
2. Sign up (FREE - 25GB storage)
3. Write down these 3 things from the dashboard:
   - Cloud Name
   - API Key
   - API Secret

**📖 Detailed Guide:** See [ADMIN_SETUP_GUIDE.md](ADMIN_SETUP_GUIDE.md#cloudinary-setup)

### Step 3: Install & Run Locally (10 minutes)

**What is "running locally"?** It means the website runs on your computer for testing.

1. Open Terminal/Command Prompt
2. Navigate to project folder:
   ```bash
   cd /workspace
   ```

3. Install everything needed:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   *(This takes 2-3 minutes)*

4. Create a file called `.env.local` and paste:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_string_from_step1
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=make_up_a_long_random_password_here
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=from_step2
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=from_step2
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=from_step2
   ```

5. Start the website:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open browser: http://localhost:3000

### Step 4: Create Your Admin Account (2 minutes)

1. In Terminal/Command Prompt, run:
   ```bash
   npm run db:seed
   ```

2. Answer the questions:
   - MongoDB URI: *paste from .env.local*
   - Username: `admin` (or your choice)
   - Email: your email
   - Password: Choose a strong password

3. Done! You now have admin access.

### Step 5: Login to Admin Panel
